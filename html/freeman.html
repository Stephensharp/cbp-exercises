        <p class="red">
            With an authoritative voice and calm demeanor, this ever popular American actor has grown into one of the most respected
            figures in modern US cinema. Morgan was born on June 1, 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a
            teacher, and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended Los Angeles City College before
            serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic arts exposure
            was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!.
      
        </p>
         <p class="green">
            Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including "Easy Reader", "Mel Mounds" and "Count Dracula" on the
            Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show The Electric <span class="unseen">Company (1971)</span>. He then moved into feature
            film with another children's adventure, <span class="seen">Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow! (1971)</span>. Next, there was a small role
            in the thriller <span class="unseen">Blade (1973)</span>; then he played Casca in <span class="unseen">Julius Caesar (1979)</span> and the title role in <span class="unseen">Coriolanus (1979)</span>.
            Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison dramas <span class="unseen">Attica (1980)</span> and <span class="seen">Brubaker
            (1980)</span>, <span class="unseen">Eyewitness (1981)</span>, and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in <span class="unseen">Death of a Prophet (1981)</span>.
            For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in
            their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an <a href="http://oscar.go.com/" target="_blank">Oscar</a>            nomination as a merciless hoodlum in Street Smart (1987) and, then, he <em>dazzled audiences</em> and pulled
            a second <a href="http://oscar.go.com/" target="_blank">Oscar</a> nomination in the film version of <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/driving_miss_daisy"
                target="movies"> Driving Miss
            Daisy</a> (1989) opposite

            <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001788/" target="my_tab"> Jessica Tandy</a> . The same year, Freeman teamed
            up with youthful Matthew Broderick and fiery Denzel Washington in the epic Civil War drama <a href="pages/glory.html"
                target="_blank">Glory</a> (1989) about freed slaves being recruited to form the first all-African American fighting
            brigade.
